# Harvest Billable Time

This is 1PPM:1 for January 2017. 

I built this to get a little better sense of how I spend my time at my desk. I've been keping track of how much time I send "working" (in front of my computer) and productive time that's not billed (learning, reading, networking, pro bono) for the last month or so. There's no great way in Harvest to see this kind of break-down. There's also not an easy way at a glance to see total billable time for the week or month, both of which are important for me to keep track of. 

So, as a part of [1PPM](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.tcua87tuv), I decided to finish what I started and get this out there. 

As of this writing, this is a WIP. I will have installation and usage documentation up by 2/1/2017.
